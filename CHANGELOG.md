## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Fixed npm installation error E404 by aligning the VRChat dependency and lockfile with the published `@nekosuneprojects/vrchat-api@1.0.0` release. The unreleased `1.0.1` tarball was previously referenced incorrectly.

## 3.0.1 - 2026-11-07

### Added
- Integrated `@nekosuneprojects/vrchat-api@1.0.0` as the second independent game provider alongside Warframe.
- Added `createVRChat()` and `createClient('vrchat')` for local VRChat JSON, worlds search/browse, groups search and avatar provider searches.
- Added GitHub Actions validation, Node.js checks, unit tests and package packing on main pushes and pull requests.
- Added manual npmjs and GitHub Packages publishing with selectable registries and npm token/Trusted Publisher authentication.

### Changed
- Bumped the gaming-infos package version from `3.0.0` to `3.0.1` for the next release.
- Consolidated publishing into one workflow, removing duplicate release-triggered publish workflows.
- Retained `@nekosuneprojects/warframe-api@1.0.1` and exact package dependency locking.


### Added
- Added `@nekosuneprojects/vrchat-api@1.0.0` as the second modular provider alongside Warframe.
- Added `createVRChat()` / `createClient('vrchat')` with bundled VRChat JSON lookups, online world search and browsing, group search, and external avatar search.
- Extended provider smoke tests and documentation for VRChat.

### Changed
- Started the 3.0.0 major-version modular rebuild.
- Removed legacy multi-game JSON cache, scripts and synchronisation workflows.
- Added the standalone `@nekosuneprojects/warframe-api@1.0.1` dependency as the first provider.
- Preserved package publishing workflows and switched them to GitHub-hosted runners.

## 3.0.0 - Unreleased

### Breaking changes
- Replaced the 2.x monolithic API and bundled game data with a small modular provider registry. Only Warframe is included initially.
- Old `gamecodes`, data mirrors and cache sync commands were removed.

## 2.4.0 - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Added mainline Call of Duty Gaming Infos coverage from `cod2003` (Call of Duty 2003) through `codblackops7`, plus `codmodernwarfare4` for official 2026 beta/public announcement data.
- Added per-title Call of Duty `characters`, `npcs`, and `maps` datasets. `characters` is intended for playable/main characters, protagonists, Operators and Specialists; `npcs` contains other campaign/game character records; `maps` contains public multiplayer/Zombies/Warzone/map/mission records.
- Added Call of Duty examples and the complete supported slug list to `README.md`.
- Added mirror smoke coverage for APINODE root `slug`/`types` auto-discovery.

### Changed
- Gaming Infos fallback synchronization now auto-discovers games and dataset types from APINODE's root response instead of requiring every new game/type to be hard-coded into the package mirror.
- Gaming Infos cache manifests now use schema version 2 and record that dataset types were auto-discovered.
- Updated package metadata and keywords for Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, Black Ops, characters, NPCs and maps.
- Bumped the package source version to `2.4.0`.

### Data policy
- Historical Call of Duty data is limited to public released-game sources. Cut, unused, cancelled, unofficial unreleased, non-canon, prototype/concept and image-only categories are excluded.
- Modern Warfare 4 data is limited to official Activision beta/public announcement information while the title is pre-release; leaks/datamines are not mirrored.

## 2.3.0 - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Added `NPCs(game, name)` and `Maps(game, name)` helpers.
- Added dedicated Fortnite `npcs` and `maps` datasets alongside `characters`.
- Fortnite `characters` now means released Outfit/skin records rather than Battle Royale NPCs.

### Changed
- The fallback mirror now fetches `fortnite/characters`, `fortnite/npcs`, and `fortnite/maps` independently from APINODE.
- The repository APINODE change-watch runs hourly and only commits real content changes.
- Volatile Game Code countdown fields are excluded from fallback hashes and are rehydrated from `expiresAt` when the local fallback is read.
- Updated package metadata for Fortnite skins, NPCs, and maps.

## 2.2.0 - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Added API-first Game Codes helpers: `Codes()`, `CodesStatus()`, `GameCodes(game, options)`, `GameCode(game, code, options)`, and `CodeCacheInfo()`.
- Added an atomic `data/game-codes/` fallback mirror for `/v5/games/api/codes`, cache-only `/status`, and every per-game Active/Expired/Unknown dataset.
- Added game-code fallback alias resolution using the cached `/codes` directory aliases.
- Added game-code cache smoke tests covering additions, changes, removals, and partial API outages.
- Added `Avatars(game, name)` for VRChat avatar records.
- Added public Gaming Infos support for Wuthering Waves Resonators, Warframe Warframes, Fortnite current/released Battle Royale characters, Zenless Zone Zero Agents, Tower of Fantasy Simulacra, and Arknights: Endfield Operators.
- Expanded the mirrored VRChat datasets to include players, groups, worlds, and avatars.
- Added `CacheInfo()` for inspecting the last mirrored Gaming Infos snapshot.
- Added automatic fallback-cache manifests with source URL, content hash, counts, and add/change/remove statistics.

### Changed
- `npm run sync:cache` now mirrors both Gaming Infos and Game Codes.
- The automatic cache workflow was changed to a daily schedule in this release and was subsequently upgraded to an hourly change-watch in 2.3.0.
- Gaming Infos and Game Codes are mirrored as independent atomic snapshots so a failure in one cache cannot destroy the other cache's last-good data.
- Successful mirror runs synchronize additions, updates, and removals from APINODE while failed or partial runs preserve the previous fallback snapshot.
- Local fallback entities expose stable slugs so offline lookups match live API behavior more closely.
- Expanded the package description and keywords for the new games, VRChat avatars, and redeem/creator-code support.
- Reworked `README.md` to document the full supported-game matrix, API-first fallback behavior, Game Codes API helpers, sync workflow, cache commands, configuration, and examples.

## 2.1.0 - 2026-08-02

### Added
- `List(game, type)` returns every entry of a type for a game, e.g. `List('genshinimpact', 'characters')` returns all 104 character objects. Tries the API's list endpoint first, falls back to reading the local folder.
- `Games()` returns every supported game's meta info in one call. Tries the API's root list endpoint first, falls back to reading every local `meta.json`.
- Added 68 Honkai: Star Rail character records, completing the bundled 69-character dataset alongside the existing Himeko record.
- Added 12 VRChat group records, 15 player records, and 20 world records.

### Changed
- Character/entity entries that have no verified working image now use `"image": ""` instead of a `"TODO: ..."` placeholder string.
- Expanded the README with `Games()` and `List(game, type)` usage and documented how consumers should handle empty image values.
- Updated the API integration guide for the all-games, type-list, single-entity, and game-meta routes, including endpoint registration and response shapes.
- Split the combined NekoSuneVR Animations 2023-2024 world record into individual 2023 and 2024 records and added a 2025 record.

## 2.0.0 - 2026-08-02

### Changed (Breaking)
- Renamed package from `vrchat-infos` to `gaming-infos` to reflect multi-game support (VRChat today, Genshin Impact and more coming soon).
- `data/` is now scoped per game: `data/<game>/worlds`, `data/<game>/groups`, `data/<game>/players`, `data/<game>/meta.json`. VRChat data moved under `data/vrchat/`.
- Every lookup function now takes a `game` as its first argument, e.g. `Worlds('vrchat', 'theblackcat')` instead of `Worlds('theblackcat')`.
- Added `Game(game)` for game-level info, `Characters(game, name)` for character-based games, and a generic `Get(game, type, name)` escape hatch.

### Added
- Lookups now try the NekoSuneVR V5 API first (`GAMING_INFOS_API_BASE`, default `https://api.nekosunevr.co.uk`) and fall back to the bundled local JSON if the API is unreachable, so data can be updated in real time without republishing this package. Set `GAMING_INFOS_DISABLE_API=1` to force local-only lookups.
- Added `genshinimpact`, `nte` (Neverness to Everness), and `honkaistarrail` games, each with `meta.json`.
- Added all 104 currently-released Genshin Impact characters, all 20 currently-playable NTE characters, and all 69 currently-released Honkai: Star Rail characters under their respective `data/<game>/characters/` folders.
